- Required for all guest purchases
- Error messages for invalid emails

### Price Calculations:
- Original price displayed
- Discounted price: `originalPrice * 0.9`
- Savings: `originalPrice - discountedPrice`
- All prices rounded to 2 decimal places

### UI/UX Enhancements:
- Green color scheme for discounts and savings
- Strikethrough for original prices
- Discount badges for visual appeal
- Success messages with savings amounts
- Modal overlays for email collection

## Future Enhancements
